# unifiedDeusEx
From ModDB

* Unified DeusEx.u, combining BioMod with latest Shifter and dxEnhanced. Extensively configurable. Fully compatible with latest versions of other common mods. Tested and stable.
* User interface dimensions doubled for modern high-resolution displays, including sharp, antialiased UI icons, rendered in 24-bit color from scratch. No more pixellated, low-color icons. Building up on work done in original dxEnhanced, we present a coherent high-definition user interface.
* DeusEx.exe launcher fixed to support scenarios requiring lots of memory. No more crashes on saving.
* A number of other improvements and bugfixes.
